Non-equilibrium superconducting thin film steady-state simulations

This repository contains MATLAB code to solve for steady-state solutions to the Chang & Scalapino equations, including photon and phonon injection. These kinetic equations describe quasiparticle, phonon and photon interactions in superconductors.
The self-consistent steady-state quasiparticle and phonon distributions can then be used to calculate surface impedance and other transport properties, and can also be used to estimate pair-breaking efficiencies ($\eta_{pb}$) for different types, intensities and energies of absorbed power.
Absorbed photons (light) or phonons of any frequency (sub-gap or pair-breaking) can be included.
This information is useful for designing superconducting devices and electronics such as detectors, microwave resonators, and qubit elements.

## Installation

Add the top-level directory to your MATLAB pathdef. Most recently tested with MATLAB R2022a.

## Operation

* Instantiate a `Superconductor` object
  * contains material parameters as well as the arrays representing energy, quasiparticle distribution, and phonon distribution
  * preconfigured materials are available: `Sc_Aluminum`, `Sc_Niobium`, etc.
* Instantiate a `ThinFilm` object around the `Superconductor`
  * contains parameters defining signal (above-gap pair-breaking photons), probe (sub-gap microwave/readout photons), and phonon injection
* Instantiate an Iterator object around the ThinFilm
  * contains parameters related to the solution convergence, number of iterations, etc.
* Run methods of the Iterator object to solve for the steady-state solution given the parameters set.
  * `it.main_iteration()` returns a new object with (hopefully) converged distributions, available via the internal Superconductor object.
  * `it.with_without_signal()` returns two objects, with solutions with the phonon and signal terms disabled, and with the phonon and signal terms enabled.

See `simple_test.m` for an example which calculates and then plots $f(E)$.

For a sanity check, try turning off all absorbed power and ensure all distributions converge to thermal distributions at the bath temperature $T\_B$.

## Convergence and solution validity notes

* Solutions may fail to converge:
  * if the absorbed power is very high
  * if the phonon trapping factor is very high
  * if the starting distribution is very strange.
* Many assumptions detailed in the theory references above
	* only considers redistribution of quasiparticles, not changes in the density of states[^1]
	* assumes 3-D, clean-limit, BCS superconductors
* No geometry is included. This approach assumes uniform photon/phonon absorption and uniform quasiparticle/phonon response. Consider calculating the quasiparticle diffusion length and time is in your system to understand the spatial scale over which this approach might be valid.
